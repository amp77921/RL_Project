# RL_Project
We are comparing AlphaGo Zero alongside Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA). The analysis focuses on the adaptation of these algorithms to the Connect 4 game, assessing their strategic development, learning efficiency, and overall competitiveness against each other.

We also look at an expanded game, Connect 6, which increases the state space of Connect 4 and requires users to connect 6 pieces to win.
